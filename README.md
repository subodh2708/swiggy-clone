## 🙌 Learning Journey

This project was built as part of my React learning journey.  
Instead of making a polished production clone, the focus was on **learning core React concepts**:

- Controlled vs uncontrolled components
- Higher-Order Components (HOC)
- Custom Hooks
- Context API
- Redux Toolkit
- Integration with real APIs
- Writing tests with Jest

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The project is deployed on **Netlify**.

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist` (for Parcel / Vite) or `build` (for CRA)

✌️ Made with React, Tailwind, and a lot of debugging.
