🍔 Swiggy Clone (Learning Project)

This is a learning project I’m building while going through the Namaste React Course by Akshay Saini.
It’s not a production-ready app, but a way to practice and explore React concepts by recreating the Swiggy web app with real APIs.

🚀 What I’ve Learned & Implemented

React fundamentals: components, props, state, lifecycle

Hooks → useState, useEffect, useContext, custom hooks

React Router for navigation between pages

Redux Toolkit for state management (Cart functionality)

Tailwind CSS for styling

Testing with Jest & React Testing Library

API integration with Swiggy’s live data

✨ Features So Far

🏠 Homepage with restaurant listings

🔎 Search & filter restaurants

🍕 Restaurant menu page (with accordion design)

🛒 Cart (add/remove items)

⚡ Online/offline detection

🛠️ Tech Stack

React (v18)

Redux Toolkit

React Router DOM

Tailwind CSS

Jest + React Testing Library

📸 Screenshots

(Add here once you take some screenshots of homepage, menu, and cart UI)

⚡ Note

This is a work in progress project.
Main goal: Learn React by building, not just watching tutorials.
